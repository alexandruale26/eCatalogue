  # Project name: ECatalogue
  
  #Technologies used: Entity Framework, ASP .NET Core Web API
  
  
  The ECatalogue application is a database manager that deals 
with the administration of the entities that can belong 
to an educational unit (students, teachers, study subjects, grades) 
by directly managing them and the relationships between them. 
  The technologies used in the creation of this project, such as 
the Entity Framework, facilitate the creation of the database 
and the organization of entities through an administrator's access 
to endpoints created through the services implemented by the 
ASP .NET Core Web API technology.
